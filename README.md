# Electronic-Shop

In this project I used .NET 6 and Angular to make a web application called Electronic-Shop. As an Administrator, you can add, delete, modify Products and view and delete Users. Users can register, verify their email and they can login to the app. If users are logged in, they can add Products to Favorites and Cart, search for products by name, and choose the types of products they want to see. They can purchase the Products from the cart and the purchases will be displayed in the profile details. For the purchase the information from the profile details will be used.

I used Entity-framework for database manipulation, SendGrid as email service for registration and registration confirmation.
To show users in a table I used Ag-Grid and for products layout I used Angular-Material.
For more details see the Documentation.
